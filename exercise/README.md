### A quick note before you dive in

If you find yourself stuck during the lab, we encourage you to revisit the lesson materials first. They're designed to provide you with the information and examples that will help you complete the exercises.

If you've revisited the materials and are still facing challenges, don't hesitate to collaborate with your classmates.

Lastly, the internet is filled with resources specific to JavaScript functions. Websites like [Google](https://www.google.com/), [MDN Web Docs on Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions), and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript+functions) are just a few clicks away. Use these as a last resort before reaching out for help.

Happy coding!
